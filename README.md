## 🧠 Problem
Hackathons are intense, fast-paced, and exciting, but they can also be overwhelming, especially when working solo or with a team. Participants often struggle to manage time, maintain focus, and balance creativity with execution. Without a clear structure or timeline, many projects fail to reach a viable demo within the first 24 hours—the critical moment for impressing judges or collaborators.

## But What if You Could Have a Personal Assistant 🧑‍💻
Clipdoki is a Chrome extension that acts as your personal guide, ensuring that you stay on track during a 36-hour hackathon. With structured phases, timely reminders, and motivational content, Clipdoki will help you break through the chaos and ship something you’re proud of.

## 🎯 Solution: How It Works

1. Chrome Extension Setup
The journey begins with installing Clipdoki—your virtual hackathon mentor. Upon installation, you’ll be guided to define your project and confirm your timeline, agreeing to a pre-set development structure designed for success.

2. Define Your Idea 💡
After installing Clipdoki, you’ll be prompted to input your project idea. This includes:
- Your idea,
- Project name,
- Hackathon start time, etc...

Once you submit your idea, Clipdoki will mint an NFT that serves as proof of your intention. It’s like a digital certificate for your hackathon journey.

3. Three Phases of Focused Development
Clipdoki helps you break the 36-hour hackathon into manageable phases. Each phase is clearly defined, and you’ll receive alerts when it’s time to switch gears. Here's how the 36 hours break down:

#### Phase 1: Ideation & Scope (20% - 7.2 Hours)
This is the brainstorming session. Think of it like the sprint to get your ideas on paper. You’ll define your core features, your MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and align with your team on tasks. You have 7.2 hours for this phase.
What you’ll do in this phase:
- Define core project scope
- Sketch out features and user stories
- Establish a rough project plan
- Alert Reminder: "⏰ Time to start building your MVP! If you are stuck, try to talk to a mentor first!"

#### Phase 2: Build & Develop (60% - 21.6 Hours)
This is where the magic happens! The majority of your time will go into coding, designing, and creating. You’ll focus on implementing features, fixing bugs, and building the MVP to the best of your ability.
What you’ll do in this phase:
- Start coding and integrating features
- Test and debug your work
- Keep a lookout for any features that might need tweaking or improving
- Alert Reminder: "⏰ Focus, it’s build time! Keep going and don't forget to commit your changes!"

#### Phase 3: Polish, Demo, & Share (20% - 7.2 Hours)
Once your MVP is up and running, it's time to add the finishing touches. Polish the interface, make sure the demo is smooth, and prepare content to share with the community.
What you’ll do in this phase:
- Polish UI/UX
- Create a demo video or pitch
- Share on social media, and ensure your team’s mood is reflected in your status ("Overcaffeinated ☕😵" anyone?)
- Submit the project for leaderboard consideration
- Alert Reminder: "⏰ The home stretch! Make your demo shine ✨"

#### [Future] 4. Social & Community Integration
After submitting your project, Clipdoki provides a public leaderboard that tracks:
- Completion status
- Community votes ("🔥 Coolest idea," etc.)
- Early submission bonus
- Each project links to a dedicated MSN-style project page, which includes:
- Project description
- Team mood status
- Demo link/preview
- Social media handles
